## Setting up
In order to use it, you will need to install the following libraries:
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Seaborn

To do so, just open your command prompt by pressing `Win+R`, type `cmd`, and press enter.
Now, just enter the commands bellow:
```
> pip install matplotlib
> pip install pandas
> pip install seaborn
```
You should be able to execute `script.py` from the directory where you have the files and generate the graph.
```
> python script.py
```
If it does not work, make sure you have Python 3 installed.
